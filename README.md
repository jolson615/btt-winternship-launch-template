Welcome to Glitch

At [Upperline Code](https://www.upperlinecode.com/), Glitch is our favorite tool when we want to make websites or host interactive art projects online. 

You can access this repo at [bit.ly/csfair-p5](http://bit.ly/csfair-p5).

### ← README.md

That's this file! We use README files to share information & instructions about how to use our code.

### ← collide.js

An artist wrote this very long library so that we could use it in our projects to detect collision between shapes without needing to get to deep into the math behind it. How nice of them!

### ← index.html

The index.html is usually where we build websites, but today we'll be scripting instead.

### ← script.js

Most of the code we write today will live in this script file, where we can write our p5.js code. The p5.js library lets us write JavaScript code that is GREAT at manipulating shapes and color on a canvas - perfect for dynamic and interactive art.
