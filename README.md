Welcome to Glitch
=================

At [Upperline Code](https://www.upperlinecode.com/), Glitch is our favorite tool when we want to make websites or host interactive art projects online. 

You can access this repo at [bit.ly/csfair-p5](http://bit.ly/csfair-p5). You can see examples of what you can do with p5 on <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/" target="_blank">their site</a>. 

Be sure to make your own copy by pressing "remix" in the dropdown menu in the top left corner. 

Your Challenges
------------

1. Remix this Glitch and rename it something you'll remember. If you have a Glitch account (or if you make one), you'll get to keep this code forever!
2. Make the scene as close to this <a href="https://youtu.be/0_bx8bnCoiU" target="_blank">video</a> as possible by modifying the settings accordingly.
3. Uncomment (remove the slashes in front of) certain dot methods like `chameleon()` and `puff()` to see what they do - use that functionality to make something different. 
4. Create the world's most amazing screen saver. 
5. Post the link to your finished project and tag @upperlinecode!  We'll give some shoutout to creative ideas. 


BONUS Challenges
-------------

* Right now the scene uses the `ellipse(x, y, r)` function to make these dots, but we could actually use any shape we find on the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape" target="_blank">p5.js Reference</a> page. Try making this page your own by modifying the display method.
* A lot of this sketch relies on randomness. But maybe that's not your thing. Maybe you prefer order and organization. Look deeper into the code and decide whether there's any randomness you'd like to remove.
