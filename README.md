Welcome to Glitch
=================

At [Upperline Code](https://www.upperlinecode.com/), Glitch is our favorite tool when we want to make websites or host interactive art projects online. 

You can access the original code for this repo at [bit.ly/btt-template](https://bit.ly/btt-template). You can see examples of what you can do with p5 on <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/" target="_blank">their site</a>. 

Be sure to make your own copy by pressing "remix" in the dropdown menu in the top left corner. 

Setting Up
------------

1. Designate a team captain to remix this Glitch and rename it something you'll remember. Bonus: if you have a Glitch account (or if you make one), you'll get to keep this code forever!
2. Have the team captain invite the other team members to this link.
