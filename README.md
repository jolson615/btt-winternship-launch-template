Welcome to Glitch
=================

At [Upperline Code](https://www.upperlinecode.com/), Glitch is our favorite tool when we want to make websites or host interactive art projects online. 


Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file! We use README files to share information & instructions about how to use our code.

### ← index.html

The index.html is usually where we build websites, but today we're focusing on p5.js, a library where we can use JavaScript to create dynamic and even interactive art. 

### ← script.js

Most of the code we write today will live in this script file, where we can write our p5.js code.
